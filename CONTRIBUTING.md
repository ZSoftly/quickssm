# Contributing to ZTiAWS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ZTiAWS! We especially welcome contributions for new AWS regions.

## Adding a New Region

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your region to `src/regions.sh`
3. Follow this format:
```bash
case "$1" in
    "SHORTCODE") echo "aws-region-name" ;;  # Location/City
```
Example:
```bash
    "euw2") echo "eu-west-2" ;;  # London
```

### Region Code Guidelines
- Use 4 characters: area (2) + region number (2)
- Examples:
  - `use1` - US East 1
  - `euw2` - EU West 2
  - `aps1` - Asia Pacific Singapore

### Required Information
When submitting a new region, include:
1. AWS Region name (e.g., `eu-west-2`)
2. Location/City (e.g., "London")
3. AWS documentation reference
4. Region availability confirmation

```
5. Submit a Pull Request

## Pull Request Process

## ðŸš€ Releasing a New Version

For maintainers who want to create a new release:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes (including merged PRs)
git pull origin main

# Ensure all changes are committed and the working directory is clean
git status

# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Version 1.x.x: Brief description of changes"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.x.x
```

After pushing the tag, go to the GitHub repository and:
1. Click on "Releases"
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select the tag you just pushed
4. Add release notes
5. Publish the release

This process ensures that releases are always created from the stable main branch after code has been properly reviewed and merged.

# Contributing to ZTiAWS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ZTiAWS! We especially welcome contributions for new AWS regions.

## Adding a New Region

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your region to `src/regions.sh`
3. Follow this format:
```bash
case "$1" in
    "SHORTCODE") echo "aws-region-name" ;;  # Location/City
```
Example:
```bash
    "euw2") echo "eu-west-2" ;;  # London
```

### Region Code Guidelines
- Use 4 characters: area (2) + region number (2)
- Examples:
  - `use1` - US East 1
  - `euw2` - EU West 2
  - `aps1` - Asia Pacific Singapore

### Required Information
When submitting a new region, include:
1. AWS Region name (e.g., `eu-west-2`)
2. Location/City (e.g., "London")
3. AWS documentation reference
4. Region availability confirmation

```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests

```
5. Submit a Pull Request

## Pull Request Process

## ðŸš€ Releasing a New Version

ZTiAWS now uses an automated release process through GitHub Actions:

1. Make sure you're on the main branch
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Ensure all changes are committed and the working directory is clean
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Update the version numbers in the files:
   - Update VERSION variable in `ssm` and/or `authaws` scripts
   - Add a new entry to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Update `RELEASE_NOTES.txt` with details for this release

4. Commit these version changes
   ```bash
   git add ssm authaws CHANGELOG.md RELEASE_NOTES.txt
   git commit -m "Bump version to vX.Y.Z"
   ```

5. Create and push an annotated tag
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z: Brief description of changes" 
   git push origin main vX.Y.Z
   ```

6. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Create a new GitHub release using the tag
   - Use the content of RELEASE_NOTES.txt as the release description
   - Validate the scripts using shellcheck

The automated process ensures that releases are consistent and reduces manual steps needed for creating releases.

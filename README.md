**ZTiAWS** (ZSoftly Tools for AWS) is a collection of streamlined CLI tools that make AWS management effortless. Developed by [ZSoftly](https://zsoftly.com), these open-source utilities help you connect to EC2 instances and authenticate with AWS SSO without the typical complexity.

> **"Life's too short for long AWS commands"** - ZSoftly Team

## üöÄ Key Features

- **ssm**: Connect to EC2 instances using intuitive short region codes
- **authaws**: Streamlined AWS SSO authentication with interactive account/role selection
- Smart interactive listing of available instances and accounts
- Automatic validation of AWS CLI and required plugins
- Support for multiple AWS regions with simple shortcodes
- Color-coded output for enhanced readability
- Time-saving workflows designed by AWS practitioners for real-world use

## üìã Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed ([official installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
- AWS Session Manager plugin (can be installed interactively via `ssm check`)
- AWS credentials configured (`aws configure`)
- Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell
- Proper IAM permissions for SSM Session Manager and SSO access
- Additional utilities: `jq` and `fzf` (required for `authaws`)

## ‚ö° Quick Start

One-liner to download, install, and start using both tools:

**Bash users:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git && cd ztiaws && chmod +x ssm authaws && ./ssm check && echo -e "\n# Add ZTiAWS to PATH\nexport PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

**Zsh users:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git && cd ztiaws && chmod +x ssm authaws && ./ssm check && echo -e "\n# Add ZTiAWS to PATH\nexport PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

**PowerShell users:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git
cd ztiaws
# Follow the PowerShell setup in the detailed installation section
```

After running the appropriate command for your shell, you can use the tools by simply typing `ssm` or `authaws` from anywhere.

## üîß Installation Options

### Option 1: Local User Installation (Recommended)

**Bash users:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git
cd ztiaws
chmod +x ssm authaws
./ssm check
./authaws check
echo -e "\n# Add ZTiAWS to PATH\nexport PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Zsh users:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git
cd ztiaws
chmod +x ssm authaws
./ssm check
./authaws check
echo -e "\n# Add ZTiAWS to PATH\nexport PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**PowerShell users:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git
cd ztiaws
# Copy the profile to your PowerShell profile directory
Copy-Item .\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 $PROFILE
# Reload your profile
. $PROFILE
```

This is the recommended approach because:
- Keeps AWS tooling scoped to your user
- Maintains better security practices
- Makes updates easier without requiring sudo/admin privileges
- Aligns with AWS credentials being stored per-user
- Follows principle of least privilege
- Easier to manage different AWS configurations per user

### Option 2: System-wide Installation (Not Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git
cd ztiaws
chmod +x ssm authaws
./ssm check
./authaws check
INSTALL_DIR="$(pwd)"
sudo ln -s "$INSTALL_DIR/ssm" /usr/local/bin/ssm
sudo ln -s "$INSTALL_DIR/authaws" /usr/local/bin/authaws
sudo ln -s "$INSTALL_DIR/src" /usr/local/bin/src
```

Not recommended because:
- Any user on the system could run the tool and potentially access AWS resources
- Doesn't align well with per-user AWS credential management
- Requires sudo privileges for updates and modifications
- Can lead to security and audit tracking complications
- Makes it harder to manage different AWS configurations for different users

## üîÑ Updating from Previous Versions

> **Note:** This repository was previously named "quickssm" and has been renamed to "ZTiAWS" as of March 2025. This note will be removed in June 2025.

If you're updating from the previous repository name (quickssm) or older versions:

### Option 1: Clean Update (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to your installation directory
cd /path/to/old/quickssm

# Backup your .env file if you have one
cp .env .env.backup

# Clone the new repository
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git

# Copy your .env file if needed
cp /path/to/old/quickssm/.env.backup ztiaws/.env

# Update your path in your shell config file
# (Replace the old path with the new one)
```

### Option 2: In-place Migration
```bash
# Navigate to your installation directory
cd /path/to/old/quickssm

# Update your remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws.git

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Make the scripts executable
chmod +x ssm authaws
```

## üìò Usage

### SSM Session Manager Tool

#### Check System Requirements
```bash
ssm check
```

#### List Instances in a Region
```bash
ssm cac1  # Lists instances in Canada Central
```

#### Connect to an Instance
```bash
ssm i-1234abcd              # Connect to instance in default region (Canada Central)
ssm use1 i-1234abcd         # Connect to instance in US East
```

#### Show Help
```bash
ssm help
```

### AWS SSO Authentication Tool

#### First-time Setup
```bash
authaws check       # Check dependencies
authaws help        # Show help information
```

Before using `authaws`, set up a `.env` file in the same directory with the following content:
```
SSO_START_URL="https://your-sso-url.awsapps.com/start"
SSO_REGION="your-region"
DEFAULT_PROFILE="your-default-profile"
```

You can create a template file by running `authaws` without a valid .env file.

#### Log in to AWS SSO
```bash
authaws             # Use default profile from .env
authaws myprofile   # Use a specific profile name
```

The tool will:
1. Check for valid cached credentials
2. Initiate AWS SSO login if needed
3. Show an interactive list of accounts
4. Show an interactive list of roles for the selected account
5. Configure your AWS profile with the selected account and role

#### View AWS Credentials
```bash
authaws creds           # Show credentials for current profile
authaws creds myprofile # Show credentials for a specific profile
```

This will display your AWS access key, secret key, and session token for the specified profile.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### AWS CLI Not Found
If AWS CLI is not installed, follow the [official AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

### Session Manager Plugin Missing
Run `ssm check` to install the plugin interactively, or follow the [manual installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).

### Missing jq or fzf
For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install jq fzf`
For macOS: `brew install jq fzf`

### AWS Credentials Not Configured
Run `aws configure` to set up your AWS credentials.

### Permission Errors
Ensure your AWS user/role has the required IAM permissions listed above.

### Shell Configuration
If the commands aren't available after installation, make sure you've added them to your PATH in the correct shell configuration file:
- For Bash users: `~/.bashrc`
- For Zsh users: `~/.zshrc`

You may need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` for Zsh) for the changes to take effect.

### Script Name Changed
If you're getting "command not found" for `auth_aws`, note that the script has been renamed to `authaws` in v1.4.0+. Update your scripts and aliases accordingly.

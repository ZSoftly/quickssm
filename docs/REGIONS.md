## Region Status Definitions

- **Active**: Region is fully supported and tested
- **Beta**: Region support is new or under testing
- **Deprecated**: Region support will be removed in future versions

## Region Naming Convention

Shortcodes follow this pattern:
- First 3 characters: Geographic area (e.g., 'use' for US East)
- Last character: Region number

Examples:
- `use1` = US East 1
- `cac1` = Canada Central 1
- `euw1` = EU West 1
